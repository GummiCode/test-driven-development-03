Exercise: Write code to process the data generated by a supermarket barcode scanner.

The code must contain four functions, which do the following:
    - 'Scan an item using a 'barcode' so that its details can be fetched from a data set. The barcode is a string which corresponds to the 'barcode' property of an item in the database.
    - Add an item to a basket. The basket is an array. It is initially empty.
    - See the total price of all items in the basket. This should be returned by the function as a single numerical value.
    - Remove an item from the basket array.

The data set is an array of objects, each containing:
    - the item description as a string (eg. 'apple')
    - the item barcode as a string( eg. 'b101')
    - the item cost as a number (eg. 0.99)
